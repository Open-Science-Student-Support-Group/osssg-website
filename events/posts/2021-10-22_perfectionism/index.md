Join OSSSG as we explore the concept of perfectionism, its impact on our lives, and how we might reflect on our tendencies and decide to let go a bit more! This session will include brief videos and information about the concepts, facilitated discussions, and relevant exercises guided by two “un-expert” students, Brittany Lindsay and Arianna Gibson, who are excited to explore this concept with everyone! Although less focused on open-scence than our typical events, this topic was indicated as an interest to our members and will help bring us together as a community. We look forward to seeing you there!
