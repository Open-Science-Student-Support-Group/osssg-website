Eden-Raye (Raye) Lukacik is a PhD candidate in the Industrial-Organizational  specialization. Her experience has involved creating and validating propriety measures–a low thrill roller coaster of science and industry. Samantha Jones is a PhD candidate in the Industrial Organizational specialization and a lead facilitator with the Individual and Team Performance Lab. Her applied experiences largely focus on team dynamics and performance, leadership, and training in healthcare and education settings. Her biggest partnership challenge is balancing the client’s needs with good scientific design. We will discuss the benefits we’ve experienced, the challenges we’ve encountered, and some considerations for anyone looking to work with industry!
