In academia, we are surrounded by assessments and critiques, and many high-achieving students often refer to themselves as perfectionists. Join Brittany Lindsay, PhD candidate and recovering perfectionist, as we explore the concept of perfectionism, its impact on our lives, and how we can welcome uncertainty and embrace vulnerability in academics, including open science practices. This session will include information about relevant concepts, facilitated discussions, and space for reflection.
