Talking about questionable research practices may be uncomfortable. You may be thinking: what if I’ve been a part of questionable research practices, either knowingly or unknowingly? What if I don’t know why a particular research practice is questionable? What if I don’t even know what QRP stands for?

QRPs can be a very challenging topic for many reasons, but they are necessary to confront when working towards more open and accessible science. Our very own Chelsea Moran has a new pre-print that found that QRPs are more common than not amongst Canadian psychology students, highlighting the importance and relevance of this topic in our current context.

Join us for an informal discussion about QRPs in graduate student research. We encourage you to read Chelsea’s [pre-print](https://psyarxiv.com/kjby3), check out her [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/chelseavmoran/status/1418622122268762118?s=20) or watch her [12-minute video presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8z7nnh52lc3u2q9/64766-12MIN-Moran-PrevalenceOfQuestionable.mp4?dl=0) for an overview of what QRPs are and the key takeaways from the survey. This will be an open, non-judgmental space to raise questions or comments you have about QRPs, thoughts provoked by the pre-print, or to discuss instances when you’ve encountered QRPs, either first or second-hand.
