The Open Science Student Support Group (OSSSG - Oh! - Triple S â€“ Gee) was founded in 2020 in the Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, by a group of graduate students eager to learn about different open science practices and support each other in implementing them in our own research.

We are back after a summer hiatus! After organizing 12 sessions during the 2020-2021 academic year, we hope to use our first session of the Fall 2021 semester to connect and reconnect. Join us for an introduction and refresher to open science, a presentation and discussion of the OSSSG's vision statement, goals, values and organizing structure and just spend some time getting to know and checking in with one another. There will be lots of space provided to share ideas and set priorities for this semester.
