Chances are, youâ€™ve heard the term open science come up in your classes or research work. But you may not be sure what open science is all about or how the concepts of open science can be applied to your research. In this session we will unpack what open science means and provide an overview of why it is important for advancing psychological science. This session will feature brief presentations on the basics of open science, with ample time for group discussions about different open science practices and how you can start implementing such practices into your research! Whether you are encountering open science for the first time, or have experience using open science practices, there will be something to gain for everyone!
