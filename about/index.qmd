## Who We Are?

OSSSG (Oh! - Triple S â€“ Gee) was founded in 2020 in the Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, by a group of graduate students eager to learn about different open science practices and support each other in implementing them in our own research.

## Our Vision Statement

We aim to develop a thriving student-led community that is dedicated to the promotion, normalization, and practice of open and inclusive scientific research.

## How Will OSSSG Uphold Our Values?
