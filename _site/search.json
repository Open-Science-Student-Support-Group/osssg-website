My overall research interests are on\nthe impact (or lack thereof) on sex, gender, and sexual identity on mental\nhealth and cognition; and anything to do with videogames. I care about open\nscience because I believe scientists need to be accountable for our research\nand findings, and that research should be accessible to everyone. It takes a\nlong time for findings to get applied in the real world and academics need to\ndo more to mitigate that, while also dealing with misinformation and\nmisinterpretation of their work!\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Brittany Lindsay\n        Promotions\n      \n      \n          \n            \n          \n      \n    \n    \n      Hi everyone!

My research interests involve\nmental health promotion, mental illness and suicide stigma reduction, and\npost-secondary student well-being. My other interests include hiking,\ncooking, listening to podcasts, and hanging out with my pup Mickey!\n\nI am interested in open science because all science should be transparent\nand accessible, and the philosophy of open science aligns with these values!\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Michael McCarthy\n        Contributor\n      \n      \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n      \n    \n    \n      I am a data scientist and R programmer passionate about solving problems\nwith data.

Studying how people think and act has given\nme a deep appreciation for the human side of data science. Much of our data\nis about people. All of our data is communicated to people.

Some of my best memories include hiking in the mountains, biking along\nthe Bow River, and rock climbing with friends. I became interested in open\nscience during my fourth year of undergrad when I took a statistics course\nand learned how to publish a class project on OSF. Since then, I’ve\nappreciated reading about open science practices and their many benefits and\npotential areas of concern.

    "section": "",
    "text": "OSSSG sessions serve the combined purpose of building community, sharing ideas and resources, and helping each other learn about and implement open and inclusive research practices. Our aim is to create a space where everyone is welcomed and invited to contribute to each event.\nAs a content creator, you prepare and deliver the core content of a session within this framework. Generally, sessions last 90 minutes and include a break, as well as a round of introductions/check-ins at the start and interactive components throughout. While the core content may be as short as 15 minutes, we expect you to be present for the whole session (typically 90 minutes), so participants get a chance to interact with you.\nTo accommodate differences in capacity, we’ve outlined three types of content we’re interested in hosting that differ in their time commitment and compensation: Presenter (10 hours expected preparation time, $200 CAD compensation), Tutorial Guide (15 hours expected preparation time, $300 CAD compensation) and Workshop Leader (expected preparation time 27-28 hours, $550 CAD compensation). Remember, content creators are only responsible for creating the content for the session and showing up to facilitate it - all other logistics for planning the session will be taken care of by OSSSG organizers.\nIf you are interested in creating content for an OSSSG session in Fall 2022, here is what you need to do:\n\nPick an open science topic! You aren’t expected to be an expert on the topic, it can be something you’d like to learn more about through developing your presentation! You can find a list of previous topics here for inspiration.\nDecide on the type of presentation you would like to do (Presenter, Tutorial Guide or Workshop Leader). See description of expectations for each type of presentation here.\nFill out a proposal form. Tell us which topic, presentation type, and month you would like to create a session. Find the Google form here.\n\nDeadline for proposals is: September 15th, 2022\nIn the event that we receive more proposals than available slots, we will ask our members to vote for their preferred topics. Any proposals not selected for Fall 2022 can also be considered for Winter 2022. If we do not receive enough proposals for the available time slots we will keep the proposal form open for submissions throughout Fall 2022.\nPlease get in touch with us by email at ucosssg@gmail.com if you have any questions."

    "href": "documents/posts/community-guidelines/index.html",
    "title": "Community Guidelines",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In more detail, we aim to uphold the following values and principles in this community:\n\nWe hold a non-judgemental space: Talking about open science practices often brings up weaknesses, mistakes or neglect not only in science in general, but in our own research practices. In our opinion, making science more transparent and open requires us to be honest and humble about the ways our research practices are less than optimal. This is not something to be ashamed of, or to shame others for. We are all in this space to learn and find better ways to conduct our projects.\nWe encourage curiosity and discussion: Many issues in academia are grey, rather than black-and-white, and sometimes common research practices are actually problematic, so we would like to encourage everyone taking part to share their perspectives and question anything, even if it seems well accepted or normal. Ask questions when you don't understand something or are not familiar with a concept that is being discussed. Sometimes people with less experience notices issues that experts don't, simply because they have become used to standard practices in their field.\nWe share the discussion space: Try to express your thoughts and questions concisely, so everyone can have the chance to share and be heard. Avoid interrupting others when they speak.\nWe value diversity and aim to create an inclusive environment: A diverse group of participants is essential for getting a complete picture of a topic, and therefore for the critical discussion of it. We encourage everyone to share their experiences, especially when they diverge from what has already been contributed, and expect participants to welcome perspectives different from their own. We acknowledge that systemic inequalities drench our everyday environments, and that some of us hold unearned privilege due to our race, gender, ability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socio-economic status and/or other personal characteristics and their intersections, while others face disadvantages. We aim to actively counteract these inequalities by acknowledging them (to address an issue, it first needs to be recognized), keeping track of the diversity of the materials used and the persons participating and presenting in our group, and addressing any gaps in representation, instances of discrimination, use of inappropriate language and microaggressions. At the same time, we recognize our limitations in identifying, preventing and addressing such inequalities, and welcome feedback on how to improve our practices.\nWe use inclusive, respectful language: Be considerate of how the language you use may impact others. Violent language, threats, demeaning jokes, intimidation and exclusionary comments, involving, but not limited to race, sex, gender, ability, sexual orientation, gender identity and socio-economic status, have no place in our space. Even if you mean well, your statements might still have a real, negative influence on others.\nWe address and refer to others using the names/pronouns they go by: Knowing what people like to be called is a key part of talking and relating with them. When we talk in groups, we not only refer to people by names, but also by pronouns such as 'she', 'he', or gender-neutral pronouns such as 'they'. Assuming what pronoun a person goes by based on their appearance can lead to mistakes, and may make the person in question feel uncomfortable and be less likely to participate in the group. We want everyone to feel comfortable participating here, and we want everyone to know how to refer to each other respectfully. So when we introduce ourselves in this group, each person is invited to share their name and information about what pronoun they go by. If you do not wish to share pronouns, please feel free to only share your name. If you don't care which pronoun is used to refer to you, please recognize this might because people rarely if ever use the wrong pronouns when referring to you, which is a privilege that not everyone shares. In that case, you may decide to not share pronouns or to share pronouns without stating your feelings about them. If you forget someone's pronouns, you can ask them to remind you before you refer to them.\nWe hold ourselves and others accountable: We follow the accountable spaces guidelines put forth by CommunityWise in their Anti-Racist Organizational Change (AROC) resources. In brief, we are open to critical self-reflection, avoid making assumptions about other people, consider our privilege and potential power dynamics that might be present, and apologize, listen and adjust our behaviour when we say something problematic. When we see something inappropriate happening, we speak up, or, if we don't feel comfortable intervening, we find other ways to address the situation, e.g., you can contact the OSSSG's conflict resolution response team – see the Conflict Resolution Document for contact info.\nWe prioritize health and mental well-being: Graduate school is stressful, and life can take all kinds of expected and unexpected turns, so it's okay not to feel okay sometimes. In our group, we welcome everyone as they are in the moment, there is space for all emotions – except those harmful to others. We aim to make this a space where people do not feel they have to pretend to be fine when they are really not, a space where everyone can share and find support, whether it is about open science or not. When collaborating within this group, we are flexible and understanding of changing circumstances of the people we are working with and how this affects their ability to contribute, and aim to find solutions that prioritise the health and mental well-being of the people involved.\nWe do not tolerate harassment: Unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, repeated unwanted social contact and any other kind of harassment are unacceptable. Consent is explicit, conscious and continuous, never implied. Ask the person in question if you are not sure whether your behaviour towards them is welcome or not. When someone tells you to stop, stop. See also the University of Calgary's Harassment Policy. Not following these guidelines will have consequences, and can lead to temporary or permanent removal from the group (see OSSSG's Conflict Resolution Document for the procedure), and/or a complaint being filed with the University.\nWe respect the privacy and safety of others: To ensure that people can safely engage with our group, we ask that you do not share any personal information shared in this group (either verbally or written) or photograph others without their permission. Doxing, i.e. publicly sharing (or threatening to share) private and/or personally identifying information without the permission of others is a form of harassment, and will be addressed as such.\nWe value collaboration over competition: Our group is a space where we come together to learn, where we let go of the competitive nature of grad school and academia in general. We are all capable human beings, with our own strengths and limitations, and we can achieve the most when we collaborate and help each other. This space is not about who is 'best in open science', but a place to find and give support to each other. Every step taken towards making science more open is great, and we appreciate and celebrate each one. The challenges used in our group are geared towards personal development, not to spur competition.\nWe give credit where credit is due: While our group, just like Open Science, greatly values sharing and collaboration,this does not mean the contributions of individuals should go unnoticed. On the contrary, we aim to acknowledge all contributions to our group, and encourage members to share their work through Open Science channels/using licenses, because we believe such sharing can lead to greater use and recognition of your work.\nWe value transparency and ongoing feedback: In our group, we aim to make decision and organizing processes transparent, and to continuously engage with members to receive feedback on our group and how we can grow and improve.\n\nOnline Community guidelines (Slack)\n\nUse threads to reply to posts (hover over a message and select 'Reply in thread'). This still notifies the people involved in the conversation, but spares everyone else unnecessary notifications.\nKeep comments focused on the topic at hand. If you have a comment not associated with the purpose of a channel, please share it in the #_social channel.\nBe aware that comments posted in public slack channels will be visible to all members. Do not post personal comments that you would not want public members to know.\nDirect Messaging is available, and is promoted for side-topics amongst a group, and one on one conversations, when the comments are not applicable to public threads.\nAll comments will be held to the standard of the general community guidelines.\nExternal links related to the discussed topic are allowed in the appropriate channels, otherwise they are only permitted in the #_social channel.\nAvoid speaking in \"CAPS LOCK\". Use appropriate language when engaging in community threads.\nFailure to follow these guidelines can result in a temporary suspension of privileges as agreed upon by the Feedback community, and continued breach of rules will result in a permanent ban.\n\nSources used in writing up Community guidelines:\n\nNeuroHackadamy 2020 Code of Conduct by Kirstie Whitaker and the Neurohackademy organising committee (licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0 CA) license)\n\nAttributions:\n\nThis code is adapted (lightly) from the Alan Turing Institute Data Study Group Code of Conduct which was itself heavily adapted from the Citizen Lab Summer Institute 2017 Code of Conduct and used under a CC BY 2.5 CA license.

The GitHub repository for the website is located at https://github.com/Open-Science-Student-Support-Group/osssg-website.\nIf you navigate to the GitHub repository you can view the source files for the website. The source files for the website fall into two broad categories:\n\nInput files\nOutput files\n\nInput files provide the scaffolding for the website, containing things such as settings for pages, written content, image files, and so forth. Output files contain the content that we publish to the web. This content is rendered by Quarto from the website’s input input files, then written to the _site directory. The _site directory contains the output files for the website (indeed, it is the website!); everything else can be thought of as an input file.\nWe publish the content in the _site directory to the web using Netlify, which is integrated with the website’s GitHub repository. Whenever a new commit is made on the main branch of the GitHub repository, Netlify will publish the content in the _site directory to the web.\nThus, the basic new post workflow involves:\n\nCreating an input file for the new post\nRendering the site to update the _site directory to include the new post\nCommitting the input file and _site directory to the main branch of the GitHub repository to publish the new post to the web\n\nThe remainder of this document guides you through this process."

    "text": "The workflow\nThere are five steps to the new post workflow. The sections below will take you through each step.\n\n1. Create a new GitHub branch\nFirst you’ll want to create a new branch that you can work on your changes in on your local computer.\n\nGitHub DesktopRStudio (built-in Git)RStudio (usethis)VS Code (built-in Git)\n\n\nFollow the creating a branch instructions.\n\n\nGo to the (forked) website repository in your browser and create a new branch. Give the branch an informative name such as post_new-post-workflow.\nNow do the following in RStudio:\n\nGo to the Git tab\nClick the Pull button in the Git tab\nIn the upper right corner of the Git tab, click main, then switch to the branch you created\n\n\n\nFollow the pull request helpers instructions.\n\n\nSee the branches and tags section for instructions on creating a new branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Create a new post\nThe _templates directory at the root of the project contains templates you can use to create a new post. Currently there are two templates:\n\nEvent post templateGeneric post template\n\n\nThe event post template is named 1999-01-24_event-post. This name will be used for the post in its URL on the site.\nModifying the template for new posts:\n\nCopy the 1999-01-24_event-post directory into the project’s /events/posts/ directory on your local computer\nRename the 1999-01-24_event-post directory with the appropriate post date and event name\nOpen the 1999-01-24_event-post/index.md file, edit and modify as needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen renaming the post’s directory, follow the formatting used in the template (i.e., date_post-name). This keeps the posts organized and easy to parse. Do not include spaces anywhere in the name, only underscores (which should separate the date and post name) and hyphens (which take the place of spaces) are allowed.\n\n\n\n\nThe generic post template is named 2000-11-18_generic-post. This name will be used for the post in its URL on the site.\nModifying the template for new posts:\n\nCopy the 2000-11-18_generic-post directory into the project’s /posts/ directory for the listing page you want to make a post in (e.g., news or documents) on your local computer\nRename the 1999-01-24_event-post directory with the appropriate post date and post name\nOpen the 2000-11-18_generic-post/index.md file, edit and modify as needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen renaming the post’s directory, follow the formatting used in the template (i.e., date_post-name). This keeps the posts organized and easy to parse. Do not include spaces anywhere in the name, only underscores (which should separate the date and post name) and hyphens (which take the place of spaces) are allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Author your new post\nOnce you have copied the template for the new post to the listing page you want you can start editing the input file for the post inside your editor (RStudio or VS Code). This is the index.md file located inside the directory for the post. Do not rename this file.\nPlease see the Markdown basics page under the Authoring section in the Quarto Guide for details on writing in Markdown, and the Websites section under the guide for website-specific concerns.\nIf you want to add icons or emojis to your post, see:\n\nFontAwesome icons\nMarkdown emoji guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are adding files to your post, such as images, they should be placed inside the post directory. This keeps the website organized, and allows you to link to the image using only its file name.\nTry to reduce the size of the files if you can (e.g., by using image compression/optimization). Large files cause pages to load slower.\n\n\n\n\n4. Commit and push your changes\nWhen you are happy with your new post, run the following command in the RStudio or VS Code terminal:\nquarto render\nThis will render all the output files for the site, including your new post. Now you’re ready to commit these changes to your branch. You’ll want to commit the following changes at minimum:\n\nThe input file for your new post\nAny additional files your new post relies on (e.g., images)\nEverything in the _site directory\n\nFor your commit message, choose something informative such as “Add ‘new post workflow’ post under documents”, replacing certain parts here with details relevant to your own post.\n\nGitHub DesktopRStudio (built-in Git)RStudio (usethis)VS Code (built-in Git)\n\n\nSee the reviewing and committing changes to your project guide for instructions.\n\n\nIn the Git pane:\n\nCheck all the files you want to commit\nClick the Commit button to open the commit pane\nWrite your commit message\nClick the Commit button in the commit pane\nClick the Push button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the commit pane:\n\nA yellow box indicates a file that hasn’t been committed before\nA blue box indicates a file that is being modified\nA red box indicates a file that is being deleted\nA purple box indicates a file that had been relocated or renamed\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Git pane:\n\nCheck all the files you want to commit\nClick the Commit button to open the commit pane\nWrite your commit message\nClick the Commit button in the commit pane\nFollow the submit pull request instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the commit pane:\n\nA yellow box indicates a file that hasn’t been committed before\nA blue box indicates a file that is being modified\nA red box indicates a file that is being deleted\nA purple box indicates a file that had been relocated or renamed\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the commit instructions, then Push your changes after committing them.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Submit a Pull Request\nOnce you have committed your changes to your new post branch, you can create a pull request to add these changes to the main branch of our website’s GitHub repository.\nAfter you create the pull request, Netlify will create a Deploy Preview that you and your reviewer can use to preview your changes to the site before publishing them to production.\n\nGitHub DesktopRStudio (built-in Git)RStudio (usethis)VS Code (built-in Git)\n\n\nFollow the creating a pull request instructions.\n\n\nFollow the creating a pull request instructions.\n\n\nFollow the pull request helpers instructions\n\n\nFollow the creating pull requests instructions"

There is no need to ensure every question is addressed during the breakout, or that every attendee addresses every question - the conversation can organically grow and evolve based on what people in your breakout room are most interested in. Breakout facilitators should begin each breakout by going to each individual in the room and asking them to provide their thoughts and responses to the discussion questions, or any other thoughts that arose during the first part of the meeting. The purpose of this round is to give each person the space to offer their thoughts, before moving into a more free-flowing format. After this round is complete, the conversation can flow more organically, and the breakout facilitator should help keep the conversation on track, connect ideas that come up from the group to prompt further discussion, and stimulate conversation if there is a lull. It is helpful to provide the discussion questions in the chat when you enter the breakout room so that other attendees can remember what the discussion questions are."

    "text": "Facilitation tips (adapted from Facilitating Group Discussions)\n\nStart the discussion with going around and letting everyone share their thoughts/comments about the topic. The goal is to give everyone space to speak without requiring them to. There should not be pressure for everyone to speak; anyone can pass when their turn comes. You should make sure your participants panel and the chat window is open as the facilitator, so you can see if people have provided non-verbal feedback. An example of introducing such a structure would be:\n\n“We’ll start the discussion by going around and giving everyone a minute or two to share their thoughts to make sure everyone has a chance to be heard. Then we’ll open the floor to anyone who wants to respond or has any additional thoughts they want to share. If you don’t feel like sharing, feel free to pass when your turn comes. If you don’t wish to speak you can provide feedback through the participants panel on Zoom by selecting the red x for”no”.”\n\nIt is not necessary to get through every discussion question - see them as a guide to shaping the discussion. You can offer them up as questions for the group to consider (it helps to share the questions in the chat) and you can allow the group to focus on the questions/topics that are the most interesting to them.\nIf the discussion isn’t flowing, ask follow-up and/or probing questions, such as:\n\n“Can you say a little more about…”\n“Can you give us an example?”\nOffer a comment and ask for agreement or disagreement from the group\n\nIf someone is monopolizing the discussion, try redirecting with statements like:\n\n“I’d like to hear what others have to say about that” referring to what the speaker just said\nAsk another person a question when the speaker takes a pause\nExplain that you appreciate their viewpoint, but you would like to make sure everyone has a chance to contribute\n\nIf someone keeps changing the subject or goes on tangents:\n\n“That’s really interesting, how do you feel about….” and then redirect to the topic\n\nIf people keep interrupting:\n\nTry to manage the conversation order, such as “Okay, first Erin, then Malik, then Zahara”\nTry to re-establish the conversation order “You make an interesting point. I’d like to finish hearing from Noor, and then I know that Ben wanted to add thoughts as well”\n\nIf someone expresses judgement/hostility towards another individual:\n\nRemind everyone that open science is a process, and that we are all here because we are interested in incorporating this into our work"

Event planning roles involve organizing an event for our group with 1 or more other people, and can be on any topic and in any format as long as it aligns with our goals and values. Depending on the type of event, this organizing role would likely amount to a commitment of a couple hours a week starting at about 1 month pre-event, and you can decide when and how many events you'd like to help organize. Support roles involve a smaller but more consistent time commitment of max 1-2 hours per week for a semester. These roles include administrative work, event coordination, community support, promotion, and tech support.\n\nEvent planning roles\nAs an event planner, you take on the organization of one event at a time, so it involves a short-term commitment. You have the freedom and responsibility to create the content and structure of your event according to your own ideas and preferences, as long as they fit within the vision and values of our group. You don't need to be an expert on the topic you organize around, just have an interest in learning more - we're all still learning in this space so if you have some time to look into a topic and share what you've found with the rest of us that is a great place to start. You are also welcome to organize an event where you invite someone with more experience to come talk to us. We have a separate document with tips and guidance on how to get started with organizing your event, including ideas for formats you can use. Organizers in support roles can help you with the logistics, promotion and technical aspects of your event.\nWe recommend organizing an event with 2-4 people, so you have others to discuss with and divide tasks, however, you can organize an event on your own as well. If you'd like to find collaborators, you can post on Slack in the #events channel to invite others to join you. Once you have an idea for a session, you should go to our schedule of planned and previous sessions and fill in some information about the event you'd like to organize at the time you'd like to have it. We recommend you pick one of the proposed times that are open in the schedule, as these are based on member availability polls and class schedules, but you are free to pick a time of your own as well. After that, the event coordinator will be in touch to share some resources and see if you need any help.\nAll events should have a main facilitator, who welcomes people into our space and guides everyone through the activities of the event. We recommend one of the event planners takes on this role, as they are already familiar with the session material, but you can invite someone outside of the event planning team as well. If your event includes a presentation, this can be given either by one of the event planners for that event or someone else. Inviting and confirming a main facilitator, zoom and breakout facilitators and presenter(s) if applicable is the responsibility of the event planning team. We've created this template including typical tasks and an approximate timeline for organizing an event that you can use to plan your event. As an event planner, you are not expected to, but welcome to join our general meetings.\n\n\nSupport roles\nAs an organizer in a support role, you take on a small task to keep the group running smoothly for the duration of a semester. Ideally, there are at least two people working together to fulfill each support role, together forming an organizing unit, so they can discuss and make decisions together outside of general meetings and divide tasks. There is no maximum number of people that can work together to fulfill each support role, since organizing units can simply expand their function and take on more tasks when more people join. Units can do so on their own initiative, as long as the expansions fit within our group vision and values. If an organizing unit becomes larger than 4, they can consider splitting the function of the unit and form two separate units to maintain the agility of our organizing structure (e.g. it's easier to plan a meeting with 2 vs 5 people). If a support role organizer is unable to fulfill their basic responsibilities, they should find someone to take over their tasks for that semester. Ideally, at least one person from each organizing unit would be present at each general meeting. All organizers in support role functions should read our group vision, values, and accountability statements before stepping into a support role, as well as reflect on how their actions in certain roles support the objectives of our group.\nBelow are the role descriptions for the minimum support roles we need to keep the group going. These descriptions include only the base function for each unit which can always be expanded based on the capacity and interest of the organizers within each organizing unit.\n\nPromotion.\nThe base function of the promotions unit is to disseminate materials that members of the group (e.g. event planners) want to share with their target audience through the available channels, such as email lists, Slack workspaces, Facebook groups, and other select groups on campus (e.g. Honours students). In terms of EDI, this unit should at a minimum reflect on who our promotion materials are/are not reaching, and implement ways to address any gaps.\n\n\nEvent coordination.\nFirst point of contact for members who want to organize an event for the group. The base function of the event coordination unit is to facilitate the creation of event planning teams agitprovide event planners with the necessary materials and support to organize their event. This unit is NOT responsible for finding event planners and facilitators or organizing content themselves. In terms of EDI, this unit should at a minimum provide event planners with resources aimed at making events inclusive (e.g. materials on accessibility considerations and land acknowledgements).\n\n\nTech support.\nFirst point of contact for members who have trouble with any of the platforms we use (Slack, OSF, GitHub). The base function of the tech support unit is to help members use our platforms effectively and keep our platforms up to date. In terms of EDI, this unit should at a minimum reflect on who is/isn't using different platforms and provide opportunities to learn how to effectively use platforms to members of all backgrounds.\n\n\nCommunity.\nFirst point of contact for members who have concerns/complaints about anything that happened in our group. The base function of the community unit is to foster a welcoming atmosphere in our group, moderate our online spaces, uphold our values, and keep us accountable. In addition to welcoming and processing feedback, this unit should also actively seek feedback from all members. In all these functions, this unit should use an EDI lens and take into account the intersecting identities of the members it interacts with.\n\n\nAdmin.\nFirst point of contact for anyone within or outside the group who has general questions or concerns, or does not know who to contact. The base function of the admin unit is to facilitate the central streams of communication in the group (i.e. make sure organizers are aware of and have access to important documents), schedule general meetings, facilitate the taking and distribution of notes at general meetings through maintenance of a roster, and facilitate transitions from one semester to the next. This unit is NOT responsible for facilitating or taking notes themselves. In terms of EDI, this unit should at a minimum reflect on the accessibility and inclusivity of general organizing practices (e.g. general meetings, decision making) and address any issues that come up.\n\n\n\nDecision making\nOur decentralized organizational structure means that many decisions can be made by members and organizers independently, as long as they don't violate our vision and values. You can walk through this decision tree to determine who, if anyone, you need to involve in any specific decision you're facing as a member/organizer of this group. For decisions that involve all organizers and/or the larger OSSSG community, there are several channels that can be used. For decisions that are fairly straightforward/have limited options or that are time sensitive, you can create a Cloverpop poll on Slack to invite input from others. Decisions that are not time sensitive and/or require deeper discussion can be brought to the monthly general meetings for discussion. For decisions that only involve your team (e.g. an event planning team or support organizer unit) you can use the format of decision making your team prefers."

Everyone is welcome to stay in the role they were in, switch to another role or step out of support roles completely. At the start of each semester, a call for new organizers will be posted on Slack and sent out through the email list. Ideally, at least one person from both the admin and event coordination continues into the new semester, in which case the admin person will send out the call for new support role organizers, while the event coordinator person will send out the call for new event planners. If such a person is not available, this task will be delegated to someone else by admin before they step out of their role in the previous semester. Everyone who applies to be an organizer will be accepted into the role of their choice, though admin might request new organizers to fill the roles that are most needed."

While you can organize an event alone, we strongly recommend you find at least one co-organizers, so you can bounce ideas of each other and share the organizational tasks. To find co-event planners, you can post on Slack and ask people to join you, or reach out to people you know (inside or outside the group). Once you have your topic and co-organizers, you should pick a date and time for your event. There is a table in the Event Planning document with suggested dates & times based on the availability of our members, so we suggest you pick one of the proposed times, but you are free to organize at any time that is convenient for you. Please fill in your topic and organizer team in the row associated with the time and date of your choosing. Once you have done this, an event coordinator will be in touch with you to see if you need any help."

We also encourage you to do a round of introductions/check-ins at the start of each event, as this can help us get to know each other and lower the barriers for taking part in interactive aspects of the event. However, it is up to you to decide if and in what format this would be most appropriate for your event. Lastly, we strongly recommend you plan a short break in any event that is longer than 1 hour, so everyone gets a chance to stretch their legs, use the restroom and refresh so they can fully engage in the second half of the event as well. Apart from that, we leave the content and format of the event up to you. Below are some formats that we have used in the past or plan to use in the future, to give you some ideas – feel free to mix and match and use multiple formats to create an engaging event.\n\nBasic elements\n\nWelcome & land acknowledgement\n\nUse alternative formats (long/short) of land acknowledgement – we ask you to personalize your land acknowledgement to make it more meaningful and impactful\nResources on preparing land acknowledgements:\n\nhttps://arts.ucalgary.ca/news/treaty-7-and-land-acknowledgements-settlers-part-2\n\n\nCheck-in/introductions\n\nAsk everyone to share their name, pronouns and their response to the check-in, if they feel comfortable\n\nCheck-ins can be simple and short (.e.g one word description of how you feel), or longer/more specific (e.g. what is a good thing that happened to you this week?)\nThis round can also be a good opportunity to get an idea of participants experience/previous knowledge with the topic\n\n\n\n\n\nMix-and-match elements\n(non-exhaustive - feel free to come with other ideas, which can then be added here)\n\nRound: sharing circle that gives everyone the chance to share/respond to a question/prompt\n\nCan be done with the whole group or in smaller groups\nDuration of each round depends on the number of people participating (estimate 1-3 minutes for each individual, depending on prompt)\nGood for: getting to know each other, building connection, getting an idea of everyone’s experiences/previous knowledge\n\nPresentation\n\nGenerally with the whole group, but can be done in parallel groups, if appropriate\nSuggested time duration: 10-20 minutes\nPreparations: Find speaker(s)/prepare presentation\n\nPowerpoint template available on OSSSG GitHub/OSF\n\nGood for: providing participants with basic information about open science practices, additional resources to look at and sparking discussion\n\nSmall group discussions\n\n3-5 people (in breakout rooms while online)\nSuggested time duration: 15-25 minutes\nPreparations: discussion questions & facilitators\nGood for:\n\nSpeed-discussions : a series of one-on-one conversations\n\n3-5 sessions of 5-10 minutes\nBrief conversations with others in the group one-on-one\nPreparations: conversation questions\nGood for: getting to know each other, sharing experiences/ideas, checking in with each other\n\nWhole group discussion\n\nVariable length - we advise to stay within 20 minutes, as such large group discussions limit how much everyone can speak, and therefore usually cost more energy and are less engaging for most participants\nGood for: sharing/integrating what was discussed in smaller groups, Q&A periods\n\nInformal discussions\n\nCreate a space where individuals can freely ‘move around’ and join/leave different groups when they want (e.g. on gather.town)\nProvide ideas on what participants could talk about, but leave room for anything to be discussed\nGood for: talking about broad/current topics, sharing experiences/ideas, building community\n\nSocial activities (e.g. games, movies)\n\nCreate a space for people to interact freely and engage in social activities\nGood for: relaxation, getting to know each other, building community\n\nTutorial/walk-through – show participants how a program/practice works\n\nVariable length - we advise to stay within 45 minutes to leave room for opening/closing the session and interaction\nUse parallel sessions if multiple programs are introduced that might be relevant to different subfields\nGood for: showing participants how certain open science topics work in practice\n\nWorkshop – teach participants how to use certain programs/practices\n\nInteractive session aimed at helping participants acquire new skills\nVariable length - we advise to stay within 45 minutes to leave room for opening/closing the session and interaction\nPreparation is more time-intensive than tutorial\nGood for: learning skills, practice peer-teaching, collaboration\n\nBrainstorm : collect ideas on a specific question/topic\n\nRecommended to use shared document (e.g. jamboard file) where everyone can see and add ideas\nRecommended to be done in smaller groups\nSuggested time: 10-20 minutes\nGood for: promote divergent thinking, setting priorities, getting feedback\n\nProject working space\n\nGet people together to come up with and/or work on Open Science related projects\n\nHackathon\n\nGet people with a shared interest together to co-create something – this can be any of a number of things, including\n\n\n\n\nAims to keep in mind when planning sessions\nAs event planners, you are given much freedom in how you want to fill in your session.

    "text": "The short version of the OSSSG Conflict Resolution guidelines (CRG) is that we are committed to hearing and addressing concerns from our visitors, members, contributors and/or organizers. We are also devoted to ensuring that conflicts are dealt with in a timely, fair, and satisfactory manner for the parties involved.\nIn this document you will find information concerning:\n\nWhen the Community Guidelines and the CRG should apply\nHow you can give feedback on the CRG\nHow to report an issue or conflict in the OSSSG\nWhat happens when an issue has been reported\nThe Conflict Resolution Report and Response Process\nInitial Response\nIssue Summary\nConflicts of Interest\nAppropriate Responses\nConfidentiality\nAttribution\n\nWhen do the Community Guidelines and CRG apply?\nThe Community Guidelines and the CRG govern the interactions between OSSSG visitors, members, contributors, and organizers, that are situated within the OSSSG space. These guidelines apply to these groups when they interact during our bi-weekly sessions as well as during OSSSG workshops, planning/collaboration meetings, organizer huddles and social events.\nThe Community Guidelines and the CRG also govern interactions and issues that may arise within the OSSSG digital workspaces (e.g. the OSSSG slack workspace, GitHub, and collaborative documents, such as Google Docs and OneDrive).\nThe CRG document takes effect if OSSSG visitors, members, contributors and organizers have violated the community guidelines, and the issue has been reported to the Feedback and Community committee (if they are not already aware).\nGiving feedback on the OSSSG Conflict Resolution Document\nThe CRG is a collaborative document between the OSSSG Feedback and Community initiative and other parties who interact with this space, thus we welcome amendments and feedback. We acknowledge that there may be certain areas that are not sufficiently addressed in these guidelines. Thus, we invite you to make suggestions for updates or clarifications via this link to the google doc version: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15kKr1PGD9Ot7AHllYgQmCEX7bw9uYw4Z/view?usp=sharing\nHow to report an issue or conflict related to the OSSSG\nThe Conflict Resolution (CR) response team includes:\n\nChelsea Moran – chelsea.moran1@ucalgary.ca – slack: @Chelsea Moran\nJenelle A. Morgan – jenelle.morgan@ucalgary.ca – slack: @Jenelle Morgan\nGwen van der Wijk – gwen.vanderwijk@ucalgary.ca – slack: @Gwen\n\nPlease contact any one of us if you are experiencing any issues that are related to a specific or general concern within the OSSSG. We can be contacted via email or on Slack.\nWhat would happen when you have reported an issue?\nAll reports submitted will be heard/read and thoroughly reviewed by the CR team. At least two reviewers from the Feedback and Community committee will be involved in the process to ensure transparency and accountability. However, it is important to note that our team is equipped to address concerns that can be rectified with either providing apologies, requiring minor changes in one’sbehaviours, suspending and/or expelling the violating party from OSSSG. More grievous complaints will involve referrals to the relevant entities on campus that are more equipped to thoroughly address those issues.\nIf there is uncertainty regarding whether the report is in OSSSG jurisdiction, we encourage you to still relay those concerns to our team. We will not hold any negative perceptions of you if your report is deemed to have been founded outside the OSSSG or if your report would benefit from input from external parties. Therefore, do not hesitate to approach us with those concerns, whatever they may be.\nThe Report and Response Process\nWe will adhere to being compassionate and respectful throughout the process detailed below.\nThe Initial Response\nIf you have reported the issue via email, there will be a confirmation of receipt promptly sent to you, and further directions provided.\nPlease note that if you are no longer comfortable proceeding with your complaint, you may also withdraw your report and your participation at any stage of this process.\nThe Issue Summary\nIf reporting the issue by email, please include:\n\nA description of the incident (if there are any issues that may be difficult to discuss within the complaint, you can either choose to share that issue in less detail, omit from the discussion completely or share face-to-face).\nThe individual(s) involved (if you are not comfortable disclosing that detail, you could comment on general/specific attributes that OSSSG should improve) and/or any witness(es) to the incident(s) present (if comfortable disclosing).\nA brief description of when and where the issue occurred and if it is still ongoing.\nThe kind of resolution, support, or information that you are seeking.\nWhether you believe there are any members of the CR team that might be in conflict if they are assigned to revise your complaint.\n\nIf reporting an issue face-to-face, the CR members assigned will seek your permission to write a brief issue summary that includes the information listed above. You may withdraw consent for having this information recorded.\nThe purpose of the issue summary is to ensure consistency and transparency in the way in which information is gathered. It also safeguards against experiences being understood inaccurately therefore minimizing the burden of retelling your account. You can also revise the issue summary made on your behalf, and either approve, or clarify certain details where necessary.\nIf new details have arisen during this process, the issue summary will be updated accordingly. However, drafting an issue summary is not required for you to access guidance, information, referrals, or support from OSSSG.\nAfter the issue has been resolved in a satisfactory manner for parties involved, there will be a follow-up to ensure that the issue has not resurfaced; if it has resurfaced, then collaboration will resume to ensure that it is permanently resolved.\nConflicts of Interest\nIf the issue, complaint, or concern involves a member of the OSSSG CR team, that person will not be recommended to address your issue. They will also not be able to access the documentation related to your situation.\nAppropriate Responses\nDepending on the nature of the issue, the CR team will propose a course of action to the person(s) who made the report. Then we will collaborate with the individual(s) involved to ensure that it is an appropriate response before acting.\nAn appropriate response is one which:\n\nSeeks to ensure and respect the autonomy, experience, safety, dignity and security of all OSSSG participants.\nAims to provide a resolution that is meaningful and fair to all participants affected.\nEncourages accountability, responsibility, cooperation, honesty and personal growth on the part of all participants affected.\nIs context-specific, therefore does not apply the \"cookie-cutter method\".\nReflects and improves the inclusiveness of the OSSSG.\n\nExamples of responses that could be appropriate, depending on the context and nature of the issue may include: (please note that this list is not exhaustive):\n\nReferral to the relevant external entity that would be equipped to address more grievous concerns (for example: https://www.ucalgary.ca/student-services/student-conduct/report-misconduct)\nA moderated conversation between the parties involved by members of the OSSSG committees, to define specific concerns and outline proposed solutions (may also be mediated by external advisors).\nA request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from an OSSSG participant.\nOSSSG-wide policy changes to avoid repeating harmful incidents.\nAn agreement that two or more individuals be kept separate for the duration of OSSSG.\nThe temporary or permanent removal of an OSSSG participant from OSSSG physical and digital spaces and from future events.\nNothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or is outside of the scope of this Code of Conduct and/or the jurisdiction of OSSSG. If outside our jurisdiction, we will also attempt to refer the parties to the applicable governing body (such as the Student Conduct Office).\n\nConfidentiality\n\nThe information shared with the CR team will remain within the OSSSG organizing committee.

After organizing 12 sessions during the 2020-2021 academic year, we hope to use our first session of the Fall 2021 semester to connect and reconnect. Join us for an introduction and refresher to open science, a presentation and discussion of the OSSSG’s vision statement, goals, values and organizing structure and just spend some time getting to know and checking in with one another. There will be lots of space provided to share ideas and set priorities for this semester."

You may be thinking: what if I’ve been a part of questionable research practices, either knowingly or unknowingly? What if I don’t know why a particular research practice is questionable? What if I don’t even know what QRP stands for?\nQRPs can be a very challenging topic for many reasons, but they are necessary to confront when working towards more open and accessible science. Our very own Chelsea Moran has a new pre-print that found that QRPs are more common than not amongst Canadian psychology students, highlighting the importance and relevance of this topic in our current context.\nJoin us for an informal discussion about QRPs in graduate student research. We encourage you to read Chelsea’s pre-print, check out her Twitter thread or watch her 12-minute video presentation for an overview of what QRPs are and the key takeaways from the survey. This will be an open, non-judgmental space to raise questions or comments you have about QRPs, thoughts provoked by the pre-print, or to discuss instances when you’ve encountered QRPs, either first or second-hand."

Reproducibility refers to a scientific pipeline whose steps, processes, procedures, and results can be reproduced by other scientists (or future you), ensuring that results can be verified, and that the decisions that led to those results can be understood. In our first Winter 2021 session we will be joined by MSc student Michael McCarthy, who will share with you an opinionated introduction on doing reproducible science. We’ll discuss general principles and procedures, share some neat tricks to make your work better and easier to do, and go over resources you can use to make your science reproducible too."
