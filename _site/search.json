Reproducibility refers to a scientific pipeline whose steps, processes, procedures, and results can be reproduced by other scientists (or future you), ensuring that results can be verified, and that the decisions that led to those results can be understood. In our first Winter 2021 session we will be joined by MSc student Michael McCarthy, who will share with you an opinionated introduction on doing reproducible science. We’ll discuss general principles and procedures, share some neat tricks to make your work better and easier to do, and go over resources you can use to make your science reproducible too."

This session will include brief videos and information about the concepts, facilitated discussions, and relevant exercises guided by two “un-expert” students, Brittany Lindsay and Arianna Gibson, who are excited to explore this concept with everyone! Although less focused on open-scence than our typical events, this topic was indicated as an interest to our members and will help bring us together as a community. We look forward to seeing you there!"

I care about open\nscience because I believe scientists need to be accountable for our research\nand findings, and that research should be accessible to everyone.

My research investigates semantic representation and concept\nknowledge – how we know and access meaning. I’m particularly interested in\nhow other mental processes such as mental imagery are related to how we represent\nmeaning in our minds. I love to travel, but when I’m not travelling, I like to\nspend time with my two puggles, Scout and Milo. I’ve been interested in open\nscience and how to make my research more open since I started graduate school.\nI believe open science practices are critical to improving equity and inclusion\nand advancing social justice in academia.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Jenelle Morgan\n        Promotions\n      \n      \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n      \n    \n    \n      Hey Everyone! My name is Jenelle Morgan, and I'm a Ph.D. student in the\nIndustrial-Organizational Psychology Program. I work in the Selection and\nRecruitment lab with my supervisor, Dr. Derek Chapman. Our work mainly\nfocuses on how and why employees choose to broadcast their experiences with\ntheir organization and how that impacts prospective applicants' perceptions.\nI also have a budding interest in examining unethical behaviours in the\norganization and the intersection of AI and recruiting/selection. As someone\nwhose research has benefitted from Open Science practices (especially with\nthe sharing of resources used in projects), I believe in this philosophy and\nhope to further efforts to educate and empower practices around making research\ntransparent and accessible.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Kaitlyn Guenther\n        Promotions\n      \n      \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n      \n    \n    \n      I’m Kaitlyn (she/they) and I am in the final year of my Psychology\nUndergraduate degree.

I have been engaged with research\nthroughout my degree and the most valuable courses I’ve taken have explored\nhow to do research in ways that have the biggest impact on communities.\nThe more I learn about and conduct research, the more I believe that practices\nlike open science and knowledge mobilization are essential.

My background is in psychology research, where I’ve studied\ntopics ranging from attitude formation, to decision-making, to individual\ndifferences in brain function. Studying how people think and act has given\nme a deep appreciation for the human side of data science. Much of our data\nis about people. All of our data is communicated to people. Understanding\nthese relationships has been key to successfully navigating my role as a\ndata scientist, and has taught me the importance of a transparent and\naccessible approach to scientific research.\n\nIf you have a problem that you want to use data science to answer, I would\nlove to help you. I offer several\nconsulting services\nto help you accomplish your goals at any point in your project lifecycle,\nincluding long and short term consulting work, private training, and drop-in\nconsulting. I value building new connections and would love to discuss\nopportunities to work with you. Let’s get to know each other!\n\n    \n  \n\n\nNo matching items"
