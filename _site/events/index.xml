<p>Chances are, you’ve heard the term open science come up in your classes or research work. But you may not be sure what open science is all about or how the concepts of open science can be applied to your research. In this session we will unpack what open science means and provide an overview of why it is important for advancing psychological science. This session will feature brief presentations on the basics of open science, with ample time for group discussions about different open science practices and how you can start implementing such practices into your research! Whether you are encountering open science for the first time, or have experience using open science practices, there will be something to gain for everyone!</p>

<p>A website is a wonderful place for showcasing yourself, mobilizing knowledge in your learning community, building an online portfolio, or anything else you can imagine! Thanks to the power of open source software, creating a stylish website is quick, easy, and free. No programming experience required.</p>
<p>In this workshop we will explore open source tools and workflows for creating and deploying websites. By the end of the workshop you will have your very own website up and running on the web; bring a picture and bio so you can begin to customize your site!</p>
<p>We will focus on three types of websites for this workshop, discussing their differences and the pros and cons of each approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single page sites</li>
<li>Multipage sites</li>
<li>Blogs</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="during-the-workshop" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="during-the-workshop">During the workshop</h2>
<p>We will be exploring three R packages—<a href="https://github.com/seankross/postcards">postcards</a>, <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/distill/">distill</a>, and <a href="https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/">blogdown</a>—that can be used to build a website. To install these packages, run the following in the R console.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">install.packages</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"postcards"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"distill"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"blogdown"</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each of these packages come with a function to build the basic skeleton for a website, which you can then fill out, add on to, and customize to make the site your own.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># Create a postcards website</span></span>

<strong>Date and Time</strong>: October 22, 2021, from 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM<br>
<strong>Location</strong>: University of Calgary</p>
<p>Join OSSSG as we explore the concept of perfectionism, its impact on our lives, and how we might reflect on our tendencies and decide to let go a bit more! This session will include brief videos and information about the concepts, facilitated discussions, and relevant exercises guided by two “un-expert” students, Brittany Lindsay and Arianna Gibson, who are excited to explore this concept with everyone! Although less focused on open-scence than our typical events, this topic was indicated as an interest to our members and will help bring us together as a community. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

  <title>Questionable Research Practices</title>
  <link>https://osssg.netlify.app/events/posts/2021-10-06_questionable-research-practices/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<section id="event-details" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="event-details">Event Details</h2>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Chelsea Moran<br>
<strong>Date and Time</strong>: October 6, 2021, from 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM<br>
<strong>Location</strong>: University of Calgary</p>
<p>Talking about questionable research practices may be uncomfortable. You may be thinking: what if I’ve been a part of questionable research practices, either knowingly or unknowingly? What if I don’t know why a particular research practice is questionable? What if I don’t even know what QRP stands for?</p>
<p>QRPs can be a very challenging topic for many reasons, but they are necessary to confront when working towards more open and accessible science. Our very own Chelsea Moran has a new pre-print that found that QRPs are more common than not amongst Canadian psychology students, highlighting the importance and relevance of this topic in our current context.</p>
<p>Join us for an informal discussion about QRPs in graduate student research. We encourage you to read Chelsea’s <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/kjby3">pre-print</a>, check out her <a href="https://twitter.com/chelseavmoran/status/1418622122268762118?s=20">Twitter thread</a> or watch her <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8z7nnh52lc3u2q9/64766-12MIN-Moran-PrevalenceOfQuestionable.mp4?dl=0">12-minute video presentation</a> for an overview of what QRPs are and the key takeaways from the survey. This will be an open, non-judgmental space to raise questions or comments you have about QRPs, thoughts provoked by the pre-print, or to discuss instances when you’ve encountered QRPs, either first or second-hand.</p>

<strong>Date and Time</strong>: September 9, 2021, from 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM<br>
<strong>Location</strong>: University of Calgary</p>
<p>The Open Science Student Support Group (OSSSG - Oh! - Triple S – Gee) was founded in 2020 in the Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, by a group of graduate students eager to learn about different open science practices and support each other in implementing them in our own research.</p>
<p>We are back after a summer hiatus! After organizing 12 sessions during the 2020-2021 academic year, we hope to use our first session of the Fall 2021 semester to connect and reconnect. Join us for an introduction and refresher to open science, a presentation and discussion of the OSSSG’s vision statement, goals, values and organizing structure and just spend some time getting to know and checking in with one another. There will be lots of space provided to share ideas and set priorities for this semester.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: <a href="https://michaelmccarthy.tidytales.ca">Michael McCarthy</a><br>
<strong>Date and Time</strong>: January 1, 2021, from 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM<br>
<strong>Location</strong>: University of Calgary</p>
<p>What is reproducibility and why is it important that your scientific work is reproducible? Reproducibility refers to a scientific pipeline whose steps, processes, procedures, and results can be reproduced by other scientists (or future you), ensuring that results can be verified, and that the decisions that led to those results can be understood. In our first Winter 2021 session we will be joined by MSc student Michael McCarthy, who will share with you an opinionated introduction on doing reproducible science. We’ll discuss general principles and procedures, share some neat tricks to make your work better and easier to do, and go over resources you can use to make your science reproducible too.</p>
