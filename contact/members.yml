    Hi everyone! My name is Brittany (she/her) and I am a PhD candidate in
    Psychology working with Dr. Andrew Szeto. My research interests involve
    mental health promotion, mental illness and suicide stigma reduction, and
    post-secondary student well-being. My other interests include hiking,
    cooking, listening to podcasts, and hanging out with my pup Mickey!
    <br><br>
    I am interested in open science because all science should be transparent
    and accessible, and the philosophy of open science aligns with these values!

    I’m a second-year Master’s student in Industrial-Organizational Psychology
    currently studying how Asynchronous Virtual Interviews (AVIs) can negatively
    impact employment opportunities for people of low socioeconomic status. I’m
    originally from Ontario and have really enjoyed living in Calgary this past
    year. Some of my best memories include hiking in the mountains, biking along
    the Bow River, and rock climbing with friends. I became interested in open
    science during my fourth year of undergrad when I took a statistics course
    and learned how to publish a class project on OSF. Since then, I’ve
    appreciated reading about open science practices and their many benefits and
    potential areas of concern. I’m passionate about knowledge mobilization and
    how we can relate psychological research to the workplace to ensure that
    employees and organizations utilize up-to-date practices.
