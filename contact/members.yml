    I'm Chelsie (she/them), a PhD candidate in experimental psychology supervised
    by Dr. Julia Kam and Dr. Brandy Callahan, studying mind wandering and
    executive functioning in individuals with and without diagnosis of
    Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. My overall research interests are on
    the impact (or lack thereof) on sex, gender, and sexual identity on mental
    health and cognition; and anything to do with videogames. I care about open
    science because I believe scientists need to be accountable for our research
    and findings, and that research should be accessible to everyone. It takes a
    long time for findings to get applied in the real world and academics need to
    do more to mitigate that, while also dealing with misinformation and
    misinterpretation of their work!

    I am a data scientist and R programmer passionate about solving problems
    with data. My background is in psychology research, where I’ve studied
    topics ranging from attitude formation, to decision-making, to individual
    differences in brain function. Studying how people think and act has given
    me a deep appreciation for the human side of data science. Much of our data
    is about people. All of our data is communicated to people. Understanding
    these relationships has been key to successfully navigating my role as a
    data scientist, and has taught me the importance of a transparent and
    accessible approach to scientific research.
    <br><br>
    If you have a problem that you want to use data science to answer, I would
    love to help you. I offer several
    <a href="https://michaelmccarthy.tidytales.ca/consulting/">consulting services</a>
    to help you accomplish your goals at any point in your project lifecycle,
    including long and short term consulting work, private training, and drop-in
    consulting. I value building new connections and would love to discuss
    opportunities to work with you. Let’s get to know each other!

    I’m a second-year Master’s student in Industrial-Organizational Psychology
    currently studying how Asynchronous Virtual Interviews (AVIs) can negatively
    impact employment opportunities for people of low socioeconomic status. I’m
    originally from Ontario and have really enjoyed living in Calgary this past
    year. Some of my best memories include hiking in the mountains, biking along
    the Bow River, and rock climbing with friends. I became interested in open
    science during my fourth year of undergrad when I took a statistics course
    and learned how to publish a class project on OSF. Since then, I’ve
    appreciated reading about open science practices and their many benefits and
    potential areas of concern. I’m passionate about knowledge mobilization and
    how we can relate psychological research to the workplace to ensure that
    employees and organizations utilize up-to-date practices.
