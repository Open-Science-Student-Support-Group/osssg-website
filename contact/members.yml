    Hi everyone! My name is Brittany (she/her) and I am a PhD candidate in
    Psychology working with Dr. Andrew Szeto. My research interests involve
    mental health promotion, mental illness and suicide stigma reduction, and
    post-secondary student well-being. My other interests include hiking,
    cooking, listening to podcasts, and hanging out with my pup Mickey!
    <br><br>
    I am interested in open science because all science should be transparent
    and accessible, and the philosophy of open science aligns with these values!

    I'm Chelsie (she/them), a PhD candidate in experimental psychology supervised
    by Dr. Julia Kam and Dr. Brandy Callahan, studying mind wandering and
    executive functioning in individuals with and without diagnosis of
    Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. My overall research interests are on
    the impact (or lack thereof) on sex, gender, and sexual identity on mental
    health and cognition; and anything to do with videogames. I care about open
    science because I believe scientists need to be accountable for our research
    and findings, and that research should be accessible to everyone. It takes a
    long time for findings to get applied in the real world and academics need to
    do more to mitigate that, while also dealing with misinformation and
    misinterpretation of their work!

   Hi folks! I’m Emiko (she/her) and I am a PhD candidate in experimental
   psychology. My supervisor is Dr. Penny Pexman and I work in the Language
   Processing Lab. My research investigates semantic representation and concept
   knowledge – how we know and access meaning. I’m particularly interested in
   how other mental processes such as mental imagery are related to how we represent
   meaning in our minds. I love to travel, but when I’m not travelling, I like to
   spend time with my two puggles, Scout and Milo. I’ve been interested in open
   science and how to make my research more open since I started graduate school.
   I believe open science practices are critical to improving equity and inclusion
   and advancing social justice in academia.

    Hey Everyone! My name is Jenelle Morgan, and I'm a Ph.D. student in the
    Industrial-Organizational Psychology Program. I work in the Selection and
    Recruitment lab with my supervisor, Dr. Derek Chapman. Our work mainly
    focuses on how and why employees choose to broadcast their experiences with
    their organization and how that impacts prospective applicants' perceptions.
    I also have a budding interest in examining unethical behaviours in the
    organization and the intersection of AI and recruiting/selection. As someone
    whose research has benefitted from Open Science practices (especially with
    the sharing of resources used in projects), I believe in this philosophy and
    hope to further efforts to educate and empower practices around making research
    transparent and accessible.

    I’m Kaitlyn (she/they) and I am in the final year of my Psychology
    Undergraduate degree. I’m most interested in Industrial-Organizational
    Psychology and my research interests include workplace mistreatment,
    job interviews, and impression management. I have been engaged with research
    throughout my degree and the most valuable courses I’ve taken have explored
    how to do research in ways that have the biggest impact on communities.
    The more I learn about and conduct research, the more I believe that practices
    like open science and knowledge mobilization are essential. Outside of
    academics, I really enjoy spending time with my family — we spend a lot of
    time going for walks and doing puzzles.

    I am a data scientist and R programmer passionate about solving problems
    with data. My background is in psychology research, where I’ve studied
    topics ranging from attitude formation, to decision-making, to individual
    differences in brain function. Studying how people think and act has given
    me a deep appreciation for the human side of data science. Much of our data
    is about people. All of our data is communicated to people. Understanding
    these relationships has been key to successfully navigating my role as a
    data scientist, and has taught me the importance of a transparent and
    accessible approach to scientific research.
    <br><br>
    If you have a problem that you want to use data science to answer, I would
    love to help you. I offer several
    <a href="https://michaelmccarthy.tidytales.ca/consulting/">consulting services</a>
    to help you accomplish your goals at any point in your project lifecycle,
    including long and short term consulting work, private training, and drop-in
    consulting. I value building new connections and would love to discuss
    opportunities to work with you. Let’s get to know each other!
