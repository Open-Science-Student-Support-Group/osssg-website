    Hi everyone! My name is Brittany (she/her) and I am a PhD candidate in
    Psychology working with Dr. Andrew Szeto. My research interests involve
    mental health promotion, mental illness and suicide stigma reduction, and
    post-secondary student well-being. My other interests include hiking,
    cooking, listening to podcasts, and hanging out with my pup Mickey!
    <br><br>
    I am interested in open science because all science should be transparent
    and accessible, and the philosophy of open science aligns with these values!
